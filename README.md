## Overview
### Description
A price comparison app sourced by its community used to display electronic products and their differing prices from various goods locations.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category: Social Media**
- **Mobile: More convenient than a website because a user can quickly open this app on a phone, scan a product SKU with their camera and compare prices no matter where they are.**
- **Story: Because prices of products can wildly vary, users will appreciate the ability to get the best possible price for a product. Users can just browse the app and send posts to specify the product details, which include the image, the price, and the rating.**
- **Market: There is a large market for this app because it is for all people that shop frequently, especially teenagers and young adults. Our friends and family would like this app because they want to get the best prices quickly and easily.**
- **Habit: If they are a frequent shopper, they might become addicted to the app, using it every day or several times per week to compare item prices. If they shop once a while, they will use the app a few times per month or so. The average user will consume the app's content.**
- **Scope: Most of the basic features are what we did for previous apps, so it might only take a few weeks. A simple version of the app would still be helpful for the user. The app is simple enough for the user to understand its purpose without a tutorial being required.**
